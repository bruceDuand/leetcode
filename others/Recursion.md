# Recursion notes

## Problem 105/106 - binary tree construction

Recursion is a method solving problem from top to bottom, so in these two problems, root node of a subtree is the key target, based on the root of a subtree, left and right tree are built by calling the same function, which is the characteristic of recursion.
IMP: finding a common target for all the subproblems, and then recursion could be implemented.
